# AOC2022

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 in Go.

Putting these here mostly for my own reference.

I have no idea if I will finish all of these. I'll stop when it stops being fun!

You should attempt these puzzles on your own before looking at any solutions. Because thats the fun part! In any case I will only push my solutions long after the global leaderboards are full.

TODO:

- Restructure the puzzles into packages.
