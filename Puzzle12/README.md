# Advent of Code 2022 Day 12 Puzzle

[Day 12 Puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12)

So clearly this one requires pathfinding.

I knew about A star but I had never actually implemented it. I tried for hours to get my Go implementation working based on details of the algorithm. But getting it working with the input defeated me. So to progress I used an example Go A star implementation ([go-astar](https://github.com/beefsack/go-astar)) pretty much line for line to solve part 1. - I understand the implementation now but I'd like to revisit this one and try to re-implement A* directly on my own.
